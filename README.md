# CreditCardRemoval-
This Project is Just to practice my Machine Learning skills. 
In this project I've used jupyter notebook for testing.
I've downloaded a pre-recorded Dataset from internet and import the datasets to my project for training and then I used PANDAS,NumPy,Scikit and Matplotlib library
for this project.
In this project I've divided the datasets in training datasets and testing dataset. After training the data i've tested the data with new data and got result with 84% 
accuracy which is quite good maybe.
